# Engine

Engine is a simple game engine made using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).  
One of the purposes of this engine is for making easier the use of Pygame to build more complex games.  
This engine includes support for collisions, meshes, materials, game objects and scenes.  
The elements used are very similar to the ones used in the engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com/ "Unity Official Website").

## Getting Started

You will just have to install the packge

```
$ pip install pygame-engine
```
